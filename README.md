This is an assignment for my Operating Systems class CSCI 3120

This program uses threads and a mailbox system to authenticate users
read in from a file, allow them to run services read in from another file
and return the result of a service call to the main client thread.


This program only has two threads working fully with each other. That is the
client thread and the authentication thread. The program allows creates a
client thread which allows the user to input a username and password. It then
sends this to the authentication thread through the mailbox system which then
checks agaisnt a list of read in usernames and passwords to see if it should
authenticate. If it authenticates, the thread sends a message back to the client
thread with the authentication string.

Requirements
------------

This program requires `gcc` and `make` to compile.

This program is made to run on the bluenose.cs.dal.ca servers but should work
on most linux distros.

Installation
------------

1. Copy files into working directory.
2. run `make` command in terminal
3. run `./main authFile.txt serviceFile.txt`
*You can give the program different file arguments than above, but check below
for the format of each file*

Making the Program Do Things
----------------------------

1. Type in a proccess in the form of
   `processname total_duration running_state_duration`
   ex. 'firefox 20 3'

   This would make a proccess called firefox run for 3 units of time whenever it
   is in the running queue, and exit once it has ran for 20 units of time total.

2. Send intterupts to the program using kill -intteruptname proccessID
   Where proccessID is the number of the `simulate` proccess and the intterupt
   name is one below.

   SIGUSR1 - print the state of the system (list the contents of the ready,
   running, and blocked, queue)

   SIGUSR2 - the running process has requested a blocking operation (goes to
   blocked queue for 5 units of time)

   SIGHUP - re-read the config file and update the program's behaviour
   based on the new config file contents

3. CTRL-C sends a SIGINT to the program which frees the memory and exits the
   program.

4. Modifying the config file determins how often the SIGALRM runs.



Configuration
-------------

Edit the config.txt file and change the timer=x, where x is the seconds for a
unit of time, to however long you want a unit of time to be for your processes.


Method Descriptions
------------------

#### list.c and list.h - Linked List Structure ####

Linked list structure with methods for adding, removing, and getting
nodes from a list.

#### parse.c and parse.h - Main File ####

This does all of the logic, intterupt handling and gets user input for the
program.

#### State functions ####

void readyState();

	- Handles logic for moving from the ready state to other states.

void runningState();

	- Handles logic for moving from the running state to other states.

void blockedState();

	- Handles logic for moving from the blocked state to other states.

void stateTransitions(int the_signal);

	- Handles logic for what to run every time a SIGALRM inttterupt happens.


#### Intterupt Handlers and Functions ####

void moveToBlockedState(int signal);

	- Moves a proccess from running queue to blocked queue if called by
	  SIGUSR2 intterupt

void cleanupAndExit(int signal);

	- Frees all memory and exits the program when called by `CTRL+C` or
	  SIGINT

int setUpStateLister();

	- Sets up the SIGUSR1 intterupt handler for listing all of the queues

int setUpBlocker();

	- Sets up the SIGUSR2 intterupt handler for blocking running proccesses

int setUpConfigUpdater();

	- Sets up the SIGHUP intterupt handler for updating the timer while the
	  program is running.

int setUpExit();

	- Sets up the SIGINT intterupt handler for exiting and freeing memory
	  in the program.

#### Queue display ####

void printQueue(List_t *list, char *name);

	- This prints out a queue and all of its nodes in the format
	  `proccessname total_duration_left_to_run`

void displayQueueInfo(int signal);

	- This displays all of the queues and their contents when called by
	  the SIGUSR1 intterupt

void updateQueueTime(List_t *list);

	- This updates the current time every proccess has been in it's current
	  queue by 1 time unit.

#### Config functions ####

int readConfigTimer();

	- This reads the config.txt file and grabs the number from timer=x, where
	  x is the seconds for a unit of time. It also sets the timer variable to
	  the number it reads.

int setUpAlarm(int timer);

	- This sets up the SIGALRM intterupt handler to run the proccess managment
	  logic.

void updateConfigTimer(int signal);

	- This updates the timer from the config.txt when called by SIGHUP

worked with the void pointers, and how you can pop off the head and add
to another queue without segmentation faults or errors.
